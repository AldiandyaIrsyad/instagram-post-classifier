It’s so crucial to continue to demand justice for him and the entire Black community in the US, who too often, are affected by police brutality. ⁣

Over the last year, some powerful voices that I really respect and admire have taken over my platform to talk about what investing in community and public safety SHOULD look like. I’m going to share some of these platforms and profiles below, so they’re all in one place. Please follow them, and keep checking in to learn more about how we can each take real steps towards reducing police violence around the country. My hope is that we continue to hold each other accountable - and educate ourselves. There should be no room for racism, or hate, or violence in our world. And there is no way to justify murder. ⁣

I’ve been listening closely to the ongoing debates about what to do with these statues — and I really want to take a minute to talk about this. ⠀
⠀
When we protest racism in America, people think we are protesting America itself. Why is that the reaction? Because America was built by men who believed in and benefitted from racism. Plain and simple. ⠀
⠀
This is when you hear “But that’s all in the past”. So let’s be clear... those men who proudly owned and abused Black people are STILL celebrated all over the country. ⠀
⠀
There are roughly 1,848 confederate statues of in the US. More than half are in The South, and it’s not acceptable. No one should be protecting the legacies of confederate leaders and slave owners. 
⠀
If we plan to move forward, these monuments must come down. But let’s remember: Removing these statues does not erase our country’s vile history of oppression — removing them is a symbol of respect for Black people in America and it’s a step towards progress and actual equality for all. ⠀
⠀
This video is by @aclu_nationwide, which has been fighting hard to remove these statues across the country. Their Legal Director #JeffreyRobinson has been speaking on this issue for years (you can find more in the link in my bio).

I was in awe of what you could do with a basketball and knew your talent went beyond your physical gifts and stretched to your mentality. A mentality that I would take with me throughout my whole career and still use every day. As the years went by, I watched you do things that seemed humanly unimaginable. And, through ups and downs, championships and injuries, you still remained with an unwavering resolve about your mentality to remain fierce to competition. But, every time we would speak or text, something started to change... your patience and ease grew. And it inspired me to continue to grow for myself. Years passed, and the “old man” jokes would start to be traded back and forth. We both appreciated a good “ribbing.” We joked about “The Vino Club.” You nicknamed yourself ‘Vino’ to represent how one could age gracefully as a fine wine does. But, you never stopped aiming to inspire me. Your confidence in me was huge - it really affected me because I admired you so much. I don’t mean as one of the greatest athletes ever. I mean as a person. People sometimes can confuse a will to win with a lack of compassion. That wasn’t you. You had both qualities. The last conversation that we shared was about being fathers and what that meant. That was, beyond all the things that we could do in this world, our true legacy. Who our children are and what beautiful people they will become. And, I guess right now, without being able to find all the words, THAT father connection is what is most devastating for me. I am sending my love to Vanessa and your family and to the families of everyone connected in the mourning of this terrible tragedy.

Go back to the year 2001 when a young man was stepping out on his own and finding out who he was through his own voice and his own music. These two geniuses not only helped me find my identity but would be mentors and inspirers of my songwriting for years to come and still are some of my favorite collaborators. To P and Chad: you changed my life and will always be two of my heroes. And you are still doing it at that level.

Watch the full film @500milesproject in the link up top. I hope it moves you as much as it did me. And go to www.heroesandhorses.org/500-miles to find out more. 
THANK YOU to all those who have served our country. God bless our veterans. #VeteransDay 🇺🇸",627609,2548,1,653,109,0,3,False

You could feel the GREATNESS surrounding him. I was in awe. A few months later, I ran into him on the driving range at Bay Hill with a pitching wedge in my hand and he sat and helped me with my swing (despite his best efforts, I still need all the help I can get...) He changed the game forever. He defined what the modern athlete is. He flew his own plane to his tournaments. He STARTED a network JUST for the sport. He won spectacularly. He lost graciously. He was bigger than the game. And, he was one of the nicest men I have ever met.

I liked the game of golf when I met him. And, HE made me love it. Mr. Palmer, you will be missed by so many avid fans but you will forever be the remembered as THE KING. The definition of a LEGEND.

R.I.P.

And then, one man and his guns took that life away from them. That's cruel. And it's exactly against what America stands for. I try to make music that hopefully brings joy to people and makes people dance and makes people feel and makes people LOVE... Because there's nothing more pure and beautiful than that act- and the fact that that resulted in the largest mass shooting in American history leaves me heartbroken. I used to LIVE there. I hope we can wake up and realize we are ALL THE SAME. Just humans. One species. Just wanting to be LOVED.

More than a ""once in a lifetime"" artist... Just a ONCE IN FOREVER ARTIST. I'm still in shock as I write this and I feel this overwhelming grief. But, we should all turn away from that and HONOR this musician that changed all of our lives, our perspectives, our feeling, our whole being. From another planet? Probably. Royalty, for sure. Us worthy..? Laughable.

They say don't meet your idols... That they let you down. But, some of my greatest, funniest (yes, he was hilarious), and most prolific encounters and conversations about music came from the moments that I spent with him. It would be silly to say that he has inspired our music... It's beyond that. He's somewhere within every song I've ever written. 
I am sad, but I will smile when I think of every second that I had the fortune of being in his company. We have lost our greatest living musician. But his music will never die. 
Prince, NOTHING COMPARES...

I had the blessing of meeting and spending time with this man before his show at the Rosemont Theatre in Chicago, IL. He let me photograph him backstage a couple of hours before he went onstage to a beloved crowd and took them to CHURCH. I got him to laugh at a joke at this very moment... My Grandfather was one of his hugest fans, as am I, so this was a very special day for me. The Country Music World has lost a LEGEND and a hell of a man.

⁣
As often happens, before production began, Mo and I got to know each other a bit over a series of phone calls and FaceTime chats discussing the film. ⁣
⁣
Throughout production we continued to talk about all of those things but also about life and family. We are different men, but we hold the same values and have similar approaches to many things in life. ⁣
⁣
The world is in a dark place. Mo and I were talking about that on the phone just a day or two ago. As we continued to talk he mentioned that he had written a few thoughts of his own down and that he had filmed it. It’s thoughtful, thought provoking, sad and very real. It’s something we should all watch. It’s something we should all rewatch. ⁣

Today, we joined the province again to share some good news with parents. Here’s what we told them: If you have kids under 6, your child care fees are going down 25% on average. This decrease begins as of April 1st, and is retroactive to January 1st. For the average parent, this means you’ll pay $200 less each month. This is an important step forward as we continue to work on delivering a Canada-wide early learning and child care system, and we’ll keep working to make sure families right across the country have access to affordable child care. #FBF

Voici un retour en arrière - et une mise à jour - pour vous en ce vendredi. Il y a six mois, nous avons annoncé la conclusion d’un accord avec la Nouvelle-Écosse pour rendre les services de garde d’enfants plus abordables pour les familles de la province en réduisant de moitié les frais de garde avant la fin de 2022 et en ramenant les frais à 10 $ par jour d’ici la fin de 2026. Et, aujourd’hui, nous nous sommes joints une fois de plus à la province pour annoncer une autre bonne nouvelle aux parents. Voici ce que nous leur avons dit: si vos enfants ont moins de 6 ans, vos frais de garde seront réduits de 25 % en moyenne. Cette baisse entrera en vigueur le 1er avril et sera rétroactive au 1er janvier. Le parent moyen aura donc à débourser 200 $ de moins par mois. C’est un grand pas en avant, tandis que nous nous efforçons de bâtir un réseau pancanadien d’apprentissage et de garde des jeunes enfants. Et nous continuerons de tout faire pour que les familles d’un bout à l’autre du pays aient accès à des services de garde abordables. #VendrediNostalgie",47151,4017,2,1927,357,0,0,False

For too long, these stories have gone untold.

Dans le #Budget2016, nous nous sommes engagés à renforcer la classe moyenne du Canada et les personnes qui travaillent fort pour s’y joindre – et le fait de veiller à ce que les jeunes Canadiens aient accès aux études, à des emplois et à de la formation est essentiel pour bâtir l’économie de l’avenir.

If I look surprisingly calm in this picture, it’s because I was… kind of. It was taken as we were waiting in between takes and I remember being so drained from the scene, that I was stealing a moment of calm to try and recharge. Gina (Trish) and I had been avoiding meeting or having any contact with the actor playing The Creeper, Jonathan Breck, throughout the entire shoot, in the hopes that it’d be beneficial to all our performances. For six weeks, we’d been avoiding running into each other - which wasn’t an easy feat on a lower budget movie, shooting in a somewhat remote part of Florida and starring only a handful of actors. If Jonathan was coming to get his lunch at catering, we were quickly shepherded away - if he was in the makeup trailer getting ready, we’d wait somewhere else - and vice versa. When we were shooting the above scene, on our last day of working together, the mechanisms on his face wing things (?) weren’t opening properly and it required several extra takes of this shot where I’m supposed to be as scared as humanly possible. Eventually, I got so tired and it was easier for the crew, trying to get the shot, if I just waited there (rather than walking away to preserve whatever was left of the illusion that we’d spent so long cultivating). Jonathan could tell I was wiped out (I think I even started resting my head gently on his arm that stayed loosely wrapped around my neck) and, at one point, a kind, slightly twangy voice came from inside that hideously sinister face: “You doin’ alright?”
But I didn’t answer. Either I’d gotten so used to not talking to him or I was still trying desperately to pretend he was a monster haha. Or both? I don’t think, looking back, any of those games or tricks made it a better performance - it was probably a total waste of energy and time.

John is such a delightful conversationalist that, within no time, I’d almost forgotten about his phenomenal face! He and I talked about our love of Don Rickles (with whom John had developed a close friendship), John’s recent foray into fatherhood, how he overcame certain performance insecurities and certain substance issues AND how it felt to be surprised by hearing his name mentioned in “Step Brothers”. We also talk about the iconic TV show John starred on (“Full House”) and the iconic band he’s still playing in (“The Beach Boys”). John also talks about his fantastic new show @bigshotseries and his (VERY interesting-sounding) podcast “Snatching Sinatra” about the bungled kidnapping of Frank Sinatra’s son (also from @wonderymedia!).

Years before that, in the early 2000’s, we were in a crowded restaurant (El Compadre on Sunset Blvd) and Phil was telling a really funny story about an embarrassing thing that had happened to him. Rather than lean in and whisper the most embarrassing part to us, so as to spare himself the shame of onlookers judgement, he stood up from the table and committed to a full-body mime of it, while laughing his great big wheezy laugh. As funny as it was, I immediately became a little self conscious on his behalf and looked around the restaurant to see people’s reactions. Phil was an acting god to me so I just assumed everyone recognized him but even if they didn’t, they were now staring at him - he was laughing so hard his face had turned pink and his eyes were watering. But what struck me most about Phil, in that moment, was how unaware he was of anything outside the story he was telling and the people he was telling it to - he lived that moment the way he lived every moment as an actor: fully present and committed and without a hint of self consciousness. It was beautiful - something I’ll never forget and always aspire to. 
I can’t wait to have another night out with friends at a place like El Compadre, telling stories and laughing - but I don’t think I’ll ever have a night quite like that one, because nobody tells stories or laughs with quite as much abandon as Phil did 😌❤️",32986,0,0,1437,268,2,0,False

We talked about how to define “cool” and he instructs me on how to improve my impression of him (the only bit I’ve ever done on SNL... and no, I didn’t tell him that). More importantly for listeners 🙄he opened up about his family, our mutual love of Austin, acting and pickles, and he tells me a GREAT story about smoking too much with Willie Nelson and... speaking of great stories- we talk a lot about his fantastic new book #Greenlights - which is filled with them, along with some truly memorable pearls of uniquely McConaughish wisdom.

It spoiled me. It gave me the false impression that all great actors were like Alan. He treated everyone the same. He always sat and ate his lunch with the crew. He’d stay and do off-camera for the other actors even if he was just giving them “a look” in the scene. He was equally generous with his downtime, letting me and Jeremy Howard pick his brain like hungry young acting vultures. He had an unbelievably funny and dark sense of humor but his delivery was often so dry that if you weren’t present enough to catch his subtle rhythms or the faint mischievous gleam in his eye, you might think he was being a stuffy misanthrope. The thing that amazed me most about him was that, in those instances, he’d never make it clear he WAS joking! It was something that required real social courage and a commitment that I doubt I’ll ever possess but will always aspire to. I saw this happen to a few high-powered executives that sat down at lunch to put in some time with him (while ignoring other “lower status” people at the table). When they got up to leave, a little weirded out and uncomfortable, Alan gave me a sly knowing grin. I loved that moment - I loved others that I don’t remember as well. I loved him. This is a picture from the wrap party where Alan, this classically trained master British thespian, partied so much harder than anyone else. He passed away 5 years ago today. I didn’t know him well but  I still think about him all the time. 
I did a play, years later, that he had been doing for many months and had just voluntarily left, replaced by another actor. But he still came to see me in my opening night. He left flowers and a card with a message inside that still makes me smile so big.

We put up signs offering a substantial reward (probably too substantial, in retrospect, but we were desperate and not thinking clearly). The next day I got a call from a man who said they’d found our dog. I had just started to eagerly thank him when he interrupted me to coldly ask “So, can I get that reward money in cash?” In my excited relief, I’d forgotten about the reward and, more importantly, how substantial we’d made it. Red flags went off by how blunt and inconsiderate his tone was. I told him I could get half in cash and would he accept the rest in check form. “Uh... no, it’s gonna have to be all cash”, he responded. More red flags. I could’ve opened a whole red flag store, if that weren’t too niche a thing and not at-all sustainable from a business perspective. I agreed to get him cash and we set a time to meet up....

I remember being slightly nervous to work with Britney Spears - she was such a massive star in 2002 (as she still is). When she introduced herself to me in the makeup trailer, I was disarmed by how sweet and NOT famous she seemed - just a nice girl (not yet a woman) from Louisiana. She immediately made me feel comfortable, as did Tamra Davis (the director) and @shondarhimes (the writer - p.s. what ever happened to HER???) and, despite having a small part, I felt encouraged to play around and improvise a bit - such a great working environment (they even let me blatantly rip off one of my favorite scenes from “Take the money and Run”). I was also excited to work with Eric Edwards who shot some of my favorite Gus Van Sant movies like “My Own Private Idaho” and “To Die For” (we worked together again a few years later on “The Breakup”) 
Britney seemed to get exponentially more tense (totally understandably) whenever we walked off set with her bodyguard “Big something” (my memory is so bad but I remember really liking him - a massive, warm, friendly, terrifying guy). People would clamor to get to her and paparazzi were constantly lurking behind trees, in bushes, etc. 
Years later, when the tabloid frenzy surrounding Britney reached a fever pitch, I remember feeling so sorry for her. Nobody deserves to be hounded and harassed like that - least of all a very sweet person - one who behaved kindly towards a young nervous actor who occupied a much lower rung on the hierarchical ladder of that film set. 
I also loved the casting directors @kimdaviswag + @justinearteta so much. Justine was such a present + connected reader, she’d make it so much easier to be present and connected yourself. 
When I saw the movie, I remember thinking that it looked like I was wearing pantyhose on my head because the makeup people only put makeup on my pasty white face and failed to cover up the rest of my translucent body (probably because it would’ve gotten all over the sheets🤢). Though I personally think it makes Britney’s skin tone look that much nicer - and she was the star, after all, despite not acting like one :) #tbt",63767,1110,1,2160,384,1,1,False

Around this time each week, I post about a new episode of our podcast but I thought I’d share with you some other podcasts that I’ve been enjoying lately. *We love doing the podcast more than anything and are truly grateful to everyone who tunes in. Is “tunes in” the proper term? This is how new I am at podcasting (/how old I am, in general haha). We decided not to do a midweek checkin episode but will return this Tuesday when I catchup with an old friend from high school (who also happens to be a former #1 ranked tennis player)
I’ve been focusing this week on listening and learning - two things I’m not always great at - but these podcasts have helped immensely (and, far more superficially, they’re helping me w my podcast hosting skills 😏)
1. Code Switch...
This series aims to illuminate the ways race shapes our society. In this episode, host @jamilksmith examines police brutality against African Americans captured on video from Rodney King to George Floyd
“These calamities are so familiar, at this point, that their details have begun to echo each other” 
A fascinating examination of a deeply upsetting trend. 
2. American History Tellers...
I love history and think if we don’t learn from it, it’s bound to repeat itself - incidentally, that’s an original quote from me. It is! Anyway, the 6(?) part series about The Tulsa Massacre is as riveting as it is disturbing. To anyone who demands an answer to the question “why don’t ALL lives matter?” They do! But hearing about this grim episode in our nation’s history, it’ll really hit home the fact that, for SO LONG, black lives either didn’t matter or BARELY mattered. I was never taught about Tulsa or WEB DuBois and the groundbreaking publication The Crisis that @naacp published. Can’t recommend this series enough!
3. Good Ancestor...
Host @laylafsaad asks “How can I become a good ancestor? How can I create a legacy of healing and liberation for those who are here in this lifetime and those who will come after I’m gone?” She’s driven by this question and her passion and curiosity are infectious.

Maybe because I also like dumb stoner comedies. Maybe because it lets me know that the person I’m talking to doesn’t take themselves or their taste in movies too seriously. Or maybe because I’m transported back to the carefree, enjoyable experience of shooting that movie. Jonah and I were roommates at the time and we’d carpool to set together. We were both playing outrageous characters that we were given a lot of freedom with. I loved the smart stupidity of the script and had desperately wanted to work with Steve Zahn, one of my favorite actors. And the rest of the cast was terrific and so game. I think we all felt lucky to share scenes with the sweet, gentle legend, Earnest Borgnine (who I still can’t believe agreed to do the movie). There were so many moments throughout the day when the toughest acting challenge became not laughing during a take. Normally you know when a take has gone off the rails and is basically unusable, so laughing doesn’t really ruin anything - but this movie was so weird and unhinged that everything was in play - we were encouraged to act like the biggest idiots possible. It was a dream job. On the drive home, Jonah and I would usually still be laughing at something that happened on set or we’d listen to music, too tired from the day’s fun to laugh anymore. It was the best. Lately I’ve been feeling so grateful that I get to do what I do as a job.

It was hilarious and moving and all the things my favorite movies were AND, most importantly, it looked like it was made for the same amount of money I could MAYBE scrounge together (because it was). It made the idea of making movies or being in them instantly accessible - no longer a shameful little pipe dream I had but a potentially achievable goal. Years later the director of that movie would take me under his creative wing in a more direct way, putting me in several of his projects - the most formative and meaningful one being an insane experimental Human Centipede-esque romp called “Tusk” and I am forever changed because of it (in a MUCH more positive way than my character in that movie). @thatkevinsmith is our guest on today’s episode of “Life Is Short”.
